### Overview

We’re building **Dorri** — your memory layer, an **AI‑powered personal CRM** for real‑life interactions.

High‑agency people — students, founders, VCs, operators — meet dozens of people every week across coffee chats, summits, and high‑density events. These interactions are rich with potential (job leads, intros, advice, follow‑ups), but the **context vanishes quickly** — scattered across memory, notes, recordings, messages, or forgotten entirely.

Dorri solves this by giving users a structured, searchable memory of **who they met**, **what was said**, and **what needs to happen next**.

#### How it works
Users can listen in or summarize a conversation — a “memory” — and Dorri uses AI to extract the key context: **what we talked about**, **what they offered**, and **what you said you’d follow up on**. That memory is linked to the person’s profile (imported from **LinkedIn** or your contacts), with tags like "investor," keywords like "web3," and cross‑referenced with event info from **Google Calendar**, **Luma**, or location data.

#### Why it’s different
Unlike B2B CRMs, Dorri is personal — it’s a **private, local, individual memory assistant** that helps people remember conversations, surface action items, and stay warm with their network.

#### The app includes
- **People view**: Search, filter, and browse every person you’ve met — by tag, topic, or what they’re working on.
- **Memory timeline**: Event summaries, people interacted with, and one‑click reminders (e.g., “follow up on referral”).
- **MCP (Memory‑Context Prompt) layer**: Connects with external LLMs (like ChatGPT) to search relationship history, "wisdom" from conversations, or generate catch‑up messages grounded in memory.
- **Wisdom mindmap (future)**: Consolidates lessons/advice from conversations into structured, editable, traceable insights.

#### Long‑term
Over time, Dorri becomes a **personal knowledge layer** — not just remembering who you met, but **why it mattered**, and what you learned. We’re starting with students and early‑career professionals — people whose networks are growing fast, but who lack the tools to retain and activate those connections.
